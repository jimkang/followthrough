followthrough
==================

Control callback flow through a finite state machine with functions that do just one thing each.

Installation
------------

    npm install followthrough

Usage
-----

    var followThrough = require('followthrough');

    followThrough({
      start: {
        worker: loadEntries,
        params: ['/somewhere/entries', true],
        checkError: checkLoadError,
        next: getStateAfterLoadEntries
      },
      loadImages: {
        worker: addImagesToEntries,
        next: 'renderEntries'
      },
      renderEntries: {
        worker: callRender
      },
      // Skip here if there is an error and no 'checkError' function.
      end: handleError
    });

    function handleError(error) {
      if (error) {
        console.log(error, error.stack);
      }
    }

    function loadEntries(location, ignoreTemporaryEntries, done) {
      db.get({location: location, ignoreTemporaryEntries: ignoreTemporaryEntries}, done);
    }

    function checkLoadError(error) {
      if (error.type === 'NotFoundError') {
        // No, we can ignore this.
        done();
      }
      else {
        // Yes, it's a real error.
        done(error);
      }
    }

    function getStateAfterLoadEntries(error, entries, done) {
      if (entries.every((entry) => entry.image)) {
        done(null, 'renderEntries');
      }
      else {
        done(null, 'loadImages');
      }
    }

    function addImagesToEntries(entries, done) {
      var q = queue();
      ...
      q.awaitAll(done);
    }

    function callRender(entries, done) {
      render({
        entries: entries,
        parentElement: document.getElementById('root')
      });
      callNextTick(done);
    }

Why
---

Let's say you have a few async tasks to coordinate:

- Load some "entries". Getting them from the db may result in a NotFoundError, but we want to ignore that, while bailing for all other errors.
- If those entries all have images, then render the entries.
- If any of the entries are missing images, find images for them and add them to the entries. Then, render the entries.

This is what it'd look like if implemented with [async.waterfall](http://caolan.github.io/async/docs.html#.waterfall):

    async.waterfall(
      [
        start,
        branch,
        callRender
      ],
      handleError
    );

    function start(done) {
      var getOpts = {
        location: location,
        ignoreTemporaryEntries: ignoreTemporaryEntries
      };
      db.get(getOpts, checkEntries);

      function checkEntries(error, entries) {
        if (error.type === 'NotFoundError') {
          // We can ignore this.
          done(null, entries);
        }
        else {
          // Yes, it's a real error.
          done(error);
        }
      }
    }

    function branch(entries, done) {
      if (entries.every((entry) => entry.image)) {
        callNextTick(null, entries);
      }
      else {
        addImages(entries, done);
      }
    }

    function callRender(entries, done) {
      render({
        entries: entries,
        parentElement: document.getElementById('root')
      });
      callNextTick(done);
    }

    function addImages(entries, done) {
      var q = queue(1);
      entries.forEach((entry) => q.defer(addImage, entry));
      q.awaitAll(done);
    }

    function addImage(entry, addDone) {
      async.waterfall(
        [
          findImageForEntry, // Async function defined externally.
          addImageToEntry
        ],
        addDone
      );

      function addImageToEntry(image, entry, addToEntryDone) {
        entry.image = image;
        callNextTick(addToEntryDone, null, entry);
      }
    }

There's a few problems here:
- The call to `waterfall` implies that the control flow is all right there, but some of it is also out in `branch` and there's a sub-waterfall over in `addImage`.
- `start` has to do some awkward error-checking. Normally, we let `waterfall` handle the error checking, but we don't want NotFound errors to interrupt the flow. So, task functions handle errors in two different ways.

This is what this program looks like implemented with promises:

The problems there are:

- Functions are doing more than one thing â€“ the work, plus deciding control flow.
