followthrough
==================

Control callback flow through a finite state machine with functions that do just one thing each.

Installation
------------

    npm install followthrough

Usage
-----

    var followThrough = require('followthrough');

    followThrough({
      start: {
        worker: loadEntries,
        params: ['/somewhere/entries', true],
        checkError: checkLoadError,
        next: getStateAfterLoadEntries
      },
      loadImages: {
        worker: addImagesToEntries,
        next: 'renderEntries'
      },
      renderEntries: {
        worker: callRender
      },
      // Skip here if there is an error and no 'checkError' function.
      end: handleError
    });

    function handleError(error) {
      if (error) {
        console.log(error, error.stack);
      }
    }

    function loadEntries(location, ignoreTemporaryEntries, done) {
      db.get({location: location, ignoreTemporaryEntries: ignoreTemporaryEntries}, done);
    }

    function checkLoadError(error) {
      if (error.type === 'NotFoundError') {
        // No, we can ignore this.
        done();
      }
      else {
        // Yes, it's a real error.
        done(error);
      }
    }

    function getStateAfterLoadEntries(error, entries, done) {
      if (entries.every((entry) => entry.image)) {
        done(null, 'renderEntries');
      }
      else {
        done(null, 'loadImages');
      }
    }

    function addImagesToEntries(entries, done) {
      var q = queue();
      ...
      q.awaitAll(done);
    }

    function callRender(entries, done) {
      render({
        entries: entries,
        parentElement: document.getElementById('root')
      });
      callNextTick(done);
    }

Why
---

You can do something like this in async.waterfall:

Or with promises:

The problems there are:

- Functions are doing more than one thing â€“ the work, plus deciding control flow.

Tests
-----

Run tests with `make test`.
